# Robotic Arm Analyzer

A Python package for analyzing mechanical and electrical requirements of robotic arms. This package is designed as an educational resource for engineering students to understand the fundamental principles of robotic arm design.

## Features

- Mechanical analysis:
  - Torque calculations
  - Moment of inertia calculations
  - Power requirements
  - Joint analysis

- Electrical analysis:
  - Current calculations
  - Power consumption analysis
  - Battery requirements
  - Complete power system analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotic_arm_analyzer.git
cd robotic_arm_analyzer
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the package:

```python
from robotic_arm_analyzer.mechanical import MechanicalAnalyzer
from robotic_arm_analyzer.electrical import ElectricalAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzers
mech_analyzer = MechanicalAnalyzer()
elec_analyzer = ElectricalAnalyzer()

# Example parameters
masses = [1.0, 0.8, 0.5]  # kg
distances = [0.3, 0.2, 0.15]  # meters
angles = [45, 30, 0]  # degrees

# Mechanical analysis
torques, inertias = mech_analyzer.analyze_joint_requirements(masses, distances, angles)

# Electrical analysis
joint_powers = [mech_analyzer.calculate_required_power(t, 1.0) for t in torques]
total_power, energy_wh, capacity_ah = elec_analyzer.analyze_power_system(joint_powers, 2.0)
```

For more detailed examples, see the `examples` directory.

## Educational Value

This package is designed to help students understand:
- Basic mechanical principles in robotics
